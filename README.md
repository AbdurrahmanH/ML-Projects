Notebooks for Trials on RL

Hello there.

This Reop contains mostly python notebooks from projects I worked on. if it's useful to you (and u can red my code;) ),then go ahead.

I apologize for the mess you might encounter, as they were not originally intended to be shared or used by others, so the code can sometimes be so dirty.
