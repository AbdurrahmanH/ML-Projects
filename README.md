ML Notebooks


This Repo contains mostly python notebooks from projects I worked on. if it's useful to you (and u can read my code;) ), then go ahead and use it.

I apologize for the mess you might encounter, as they were not originally intended to be shared or used by others, so the code can sometimes be so dirty.
